This is a POSIX-Compliant fork of BashSimpleCurses (github.com/metal3d/bashsimplecurses)

It currently seems to work perfectly with Bash, KSH, ZSH, Posh, and Dash

A fully functional two-player Tic-Tac-Toe demo is included.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- Limited support for input (Only updated when enter/newline is pressed)
- Better ASCII detection
- Some opinionated feature removals
