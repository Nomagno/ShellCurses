This is a POSIX-Compliant fork of BashSimpleCurses (github.com/metal3d/bashsimplecurses)

While I have not done extentive testing, it currently seems to work well enough with Bash, KSH, ZSH, Posh, and Dash

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- Limited support for non-breaking input (Saved to the file the $captured_input variable points to, but only when each time you press enter)
- Better ASCII detection
- Switching to mktmp in the name of POSIX compliance, but also having the unfortunate side effect of bloating /tmp
- A lot of opinionated internal feature removals
- A (probably) fully intact behaviour
